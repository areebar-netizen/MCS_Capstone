This project develops a personalized study optimization system using consumer-grade EEG technology (Muse 02 2016 headband) to provide real-time focus tracking and data-driven technique recommendations. By continuously monitoring brainwave patterns during study sessions, the system can detect when focus declines and increases, recommend optimal break timing, and identify which study techniques work best for each individual under different conditions. We aim to implement this system through a user-friendly app meant to promote studying and focus. Unlike generic productivity apps, our system adapts to each user's unique cognitive patterns, learning from their EEG data to provide increasingly personalized recommendations over time. We plan on making this data valuable to the user to access as well so that they can further study their own focus and attention patterns.
